By default flast search for templates in folder called templates

Flask use jinja to embed non html to html file and process the entire file to replace template strings with strings and render html file to user

Explain MVC
The controller layer would handle three parts of this: accept user input, tell the model to create a todo item, and direct how the view should update.

What we'll learn in order
How we accept and get user data in the context of a Flask app
Send data in controllers using database sessions in a controller
Manipulating models adding records in SQLAlchemy Models
Direct how the view should update within the controller and views

Methods of getting user input
There are 3 methods of getting user data from a view to a controller. See the image below.
URL query parameters - www.example.com/hello?my_key=my_value - key value pair at the end of url after ? | request.args.get('field1')
    incase of objects it is better to use respose body
Forms - html submit request.form.get('username') look for property name in html - old way
JSON - modern way data type application/json then use request.data
    data_string = request.data
    data_dictionary = json.loads(data_string) parse string to json


Form Takeaways
forms take an action (name of the route) and method (route method) to submit data to our server.
The name attribute on a form control element is the key used to retrieve data from request.get(<key>).
All forms either define a submit button, or allow the user to hit ENTER on an input to submit the form.
<form action="/foo1" method="post">
   <label for="bar0">Bar</label>
  <input type="text" value="foo2" id="bar1" name="bar2" class="bar3">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
For the form the content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded and Request Body: field1=value&field2=value2
GET max is max 2048 characters

Using AJAX - asynchronusly
Method 1 - XMLHttpRequest
Method 2 - Fetch object more modern
all libriries use eithr of the 2 method

Method1
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
description = document.getElementById("description").value;
xhttp.open("GET", "/todos/create?description=" + description);
xhttp.send();

//This gets called with diffrent state and status
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    //Make sure that state 4 operations completed on server and 200 is succcessful
    if (this.readyState === 4 && this.status === 200) { 
      // on successful response
      console.log(xhttp.responseText);
    }
};

Method 2
fetch is another window object that lets you send HTTP requests
fetch(<url-route>, <object of request parameters>)
fetch('/my/request', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    'description': 'some description here'
  }),
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});



JSON.stringify() - JS convert json object to string
json.loads - Python convert string to json object
request.get_json() -> gets json get_json()['property']
jsonify return json data to client


#Successful handlling errors in controller
if you close connection and auto commit will be fired so we must handle rollback on exceptions


 import sys

 try:
   todo = Todo(description=description)
   db.session.add(todo)
   db.session.commit()
 except:
   db.session.rollback()
   error=True
   print(sys.exc_info())
 finally:
   db.session.close()

   ========================= MIGRATION ===============
changing schema after creating it. This is data migration and schema migration

Migrations

encapsulate a set of changes to our database schema, made over time.
are uniquely named
are usually stored as local files in our project repo, e.g. a migrations/ folder

There should be a 1-1 mapping between the changes made to our database, and the migration files that exist in our migrations/ folder.

Our migrations files set up the tables for our database.
All changes made to our db should exist physically as part of migration files in our repository.

Migration command line scripts
There are generally 3 scripts needed, for

migrate: creating a migration script template to fill out; generating a migration file based on changes to be made
upgrade: applying migrations that hadn't been applied yet ("upgrading" our database)
downgrade: rolling back applied migrations that were problematic ("downgrading" our database)
Migration library for Flask + SQLAlchemy
Flask-Migrate is our library for migrating changes using SQLAlchemy. It uses a library called Alembic underneath the hood.
Flask-Migrate & Flask-Script
Flask-Migrate (flask_migrate) is our migration manager for migrating SQLALchemy-based database changes

Flask-Script (flask_script) lets us run migration scripts we defined, from the terminal

Steps to get migrations going
Initialize the migration repository structure for storing migrations
Create a migration script (using Flask-Migrate)
(Manually) Run the migration script (using Flask-Script)

https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/

Without migrations:

We do heavy-handed work, creating and recreating the same tables in our database even for minor changes
We can lose existing data in older tables we dropped
With migrations:

Auto-detects changes from the old version & new version of the SQLAlchemy models
Creates a migration script that resolves differences between the old & new versions
Gives fine-grain control to change existing tables
This is much better, because

We can keep existing schema structures, only modifying what needs to be modified
We can keep existing data
We isolate units of change in migration scripts that we can roll back to a “safe” db state

https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/

In terminal flask db init --> this will create migration folder

flask db migrate --> set migration script version so we need to drop db for the first time to be able to track versions

Overall Steps to Set Up & Run Migrations
Bootstrap database migrate commands: link to the Flask app models and database, link to command line scripts for running migrations, set up folders to store migrations (as versions of the database)
Run initial migration to create tables for SQLAlchemy models, recording the initial schema: ala git init && first git commit. Replaces use of db.create_all()
Migrate on changes to our data models
Make changes to the SQLAlchemy models
Allow Flask-Migrate to auto-generate a migration script based on the changes
Fine-tune the migration scripts
Run the migration, aka “upgrade” the database schema by a “version”
It’s always helpful to read the docs!

========================== updating model

user = User.query.get(some_id)
user.name = 'Some new name'
db.session.commit()

todo = Todo.query.get(todo_id) 
db.session.delete(todo) # or...
Todo.query.filter_by(id=todo_id).delete()
db.session.commit()

===================RELATIONSHIPS

http://www.sql-join.com/sql-join-types
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-join-set-1-inner-left-right-and-full-joins/

SQLAlchemy configures the settings between model relationships once, and generates JOIN statements for us whenever we need them.
db.relationship is an interface offered in SQLAlchemy to provide and configure a mapped relationship between two models.
db.relationship is defined on the parent model, and it sets:
the name of its children (e.g. children), for example parent1.children
the name of a parent on a child using the backref, for example child1.my_amazing_parent

https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/quickstart/#simple-relationships
https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/relationship_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.relationship

When calling child1.some_parent, SQLAlchemy determines when we load the parent from the database.
Why is it important to care about when we load parents?
Joins are expensive.
We should avoid having the user idling. Delays more than 150ms are noticeable, so milliseconds of performance matter!
We should make sure the joins happen during a time and place in the UX that doesn't negatively impact the experience too much.

Lazy loading
Load needed joined data only as needed. Default in SQLAlchemy.

Pro: no initial wait time. Load only what you need.
Con: produces a join SQL call every time there is a request for a joined asset. Bad if you do this a lot.
Eager loading
Load all needed joined data objects, all at once.

Pro: reduces further queries to the database. Subsequent SQL calls read existing data
Con: loading the joined table has a long upfront initial load time.
lazy=True (lazy loading) is the default option in db.relationship:

children = db.relationship('ChildModel', backref='some_parent', lazy=True)

https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/loading_relationships.html
https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/relationship_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.relationship

db.relationship
Allows SQLAlchemy to identity relationships between models
Links relationships with backrefs (child1.some_parent)
Configures relationship dynamics between parents and children, including options like lazy, collection_class, and cascade

db.relationship does not set up foreign key constraints for you. We need to add a column, some_parent_id, on the child model that has a foreign key constraint
Whereas we set db.relationship on the parent model, we set the foreign key constraint on the child model.
A foreign key constraint prefers referential integrity from one table to another, by ensuring that the foreign key column always maps a primary key in the foreign table.

driver_id REFERENCE drivers(id) = db.ForeignKey
Option in db.column to specify a foreign key constraint, referring to the primary key of the other table / model
Gets defined on the Child model
https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/constraints.html
https://database.guide/the-3-types-of-relationships-in-database-design/

Modified our Todo model to (temporarily) allow null values in list_id:
list_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('todolists.id'), nullable=True)
Ran the migration, allowing list_id to be null
Then using psql (or any other Postgres client),

Populated our database with a default list ("Uncategorized") to add all currently existing Todo items to
Associated existing to-do items with the "Uncategorized" list with ID 1, setting todo.list_id = 1. We could have also done this in a migration rather than using psql; either works.
Set nullable=False on the list_id column
Ran flask db migrate to generate a migration file for updating the nullability constraint
Ran flask db upgrade to apply the migration

Aside
SQL commands can be written in any case (update, UPDATE, uPDaTe) and they will still execute.

Important
We always want to use migrations in order to update the data schema.
We can establish maintenance windows during times when the app isn't well used and manipulate production data then, in order to prepare the data before a schema migration, and change it after a schema migration.

In one-to-many and one-to-one, the foreign key is established on the child model.
In many-to-many, a special association table exists to join the two tables together, storing two foreign keys that link to the two foreign tables that have a relationship with each other.

Define an association table using Table from SQLAlchemy
Set the multiple foreign keys in the association table
Map the association table to a parent model using the option secondary in db.relationship
order_items = db.Table('order_items',
    db.Column('order_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('order.id'), primary_key=True),
    db.Column('product_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('product.id'), primary_key=True)
)

class Order(db.Model):
  id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
  status = db.Column(db.String(), nullable=False)
  products = db.relationship('Product', secondary=order_items,
      backref=db.backref('orders', lazy=True))

class Product(db.Model):
  id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
  name = db.Column(db.String(), nullable=False)
